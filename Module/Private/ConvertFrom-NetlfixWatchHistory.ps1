.SYNOPSIS
    Converts a Netflix watched item into an object we can work with.
.DESCRIPTION
    This helper function takes a Netflix watched item and converts it into an object we can work with.
    This is needed as there are a few TV shows/movies that have a non-standard format so we have special workarounds in place.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> ConvertFrom-NetflixWatchHistory -InputObject "Squid Game: Season 1: Red Light, Green Light"

    This would return the following object:
    {
        "Type": "TV Show",
        "Title": "Squid Game",
        "SeasonNumber": "1",
        "EpisodeTitle": "Red Light, Green Light"
    }
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> ConvertFrom-NetflixWatchHistory -InputObject "The Legend of Korra: Book One: Air: Welcome to Republic City"

    This would return the following object:
    {
        "Type": "TV Show",
        "Title": "The Legend of Korra",
        "SeasonNumber": "1",
        "EpisodeTitle": "Welcome to Republic City"
    }
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> ConvertFrom-NetflixWatchHistory -InputObject "Batman Begins"

    This would return the following object:
    {
        "Type": "Movie",
        "Title": "Batman Begins"
    }
