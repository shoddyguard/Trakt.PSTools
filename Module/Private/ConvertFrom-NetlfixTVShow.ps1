.SYNOPSIS
    Converts a Netflix TV Show into an object we can work with.
.DESCRIPTION
    This helper function takes a Netflix TV Show and converts it into an object we can work with.
    This is needed as there are a few TV shows that have a non-standard format so we have special workarounds in place.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> ConvertFrom-NetflixTVShow -InputObject "Squid Game: Season 1: Red Light, Green Light"

    This would return the following object:
    {
        "ShowName": "Squid Game",
        "SeasonNumber": "1",
        "EpisodeName": "Red Light, Green Light"
    }
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> ConvertFrom-NetflixTVShow -InputObject "The Legend of Korra: Book One: Air: Welcome to Republic City"

    This would return the following object:
    {
        "ShowName": "The Legend of Korra",
        "SeasonNumber": "1",
        "EpisodeName": "Welcome to Republic City"
    }
